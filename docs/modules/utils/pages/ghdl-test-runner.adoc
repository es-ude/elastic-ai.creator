= Test plugin `VHDL` code with `GHDL`
After installing the `elasticai.creator` the command `eai-run-ghdl-tbs-for-plugins`
will be available. That program will run over all plugin packages and

* import all `*.vhd` files with `+ghdl+`
* interpret each `*_tb.vhd` file as a testbench
* analyze and run a testbench unit of the corresponding name
  for each found testbench file using `ghdl`
* log the results into a `junitXml` file

To make this work, your `<name>_tb.vhd` files need to define a testbench entity
of name `<name>_tb` each.

== Missing features

We might add the following features in the future

- [ ] specify a basic format that testbenches should use to print results
      so that the runner can interpret and log those
	* currently most of that format is implicit
- [ ] read dependencies from plugin configurations (if present)
- [ ] automatically create waveform files


== Limitations

* The runner needs at least python3.11 currently
