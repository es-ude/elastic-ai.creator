=== Test Plugin VHDL code with GHDL
After installing the `elasticai.creator` the command `eai-run-ghdl-tbs-for-plugins`
will be available. That program will run over all plugin packages and

* import all `*.vhd` files with `ghdl`
* interpret each `*_tb.vhd` file as a testbench
* analyze and run a testbench unit of the corresponding name 
  for each found testbench file using ghdl
* log the results into a junitXml file

To make this work, your `<name>_tb.vhd` files need to define a testbench entity
of name `<name>_tb` each.

==== Missing Features

Features that might be added in the future are

- [ ] specify a basic format that testbenches should use to print results
      so that the runner can interpret and log those
- [ ] log line/file for each failed assertion from a testbench
- [ ] read dependencies from plugin configs (if present)
- [ ] automatically create waveform files
