<!--
  Please ensure that

  * Your commit messages explain
    * what changes were made
    * why these changes were made

  In case of breaking changes add

  ```
  BREAKING CHANGE: <explain what will break>
  ```
  in the footer of your message.

  Use at most 50 but never more than 100
  characters of line width for your commit
  msgs.

  Additional guidelines
  
  * The smaller the PR, the easier and faster
    it will be to review
  * If possible, include documentation and
    tests
  * IMPORTANT: keep a linear history, by
    rebasing on `main` instead of merging
    main into HEAD. This makes future
    changes easier and keeps the graph
    readable.
