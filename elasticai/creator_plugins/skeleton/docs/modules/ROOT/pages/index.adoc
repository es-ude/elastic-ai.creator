= Skeleton

This skeleton implementation acts as an adapter between the middleware and the new axi-like interfaces for layers.
It will read the input data from the middleware, store it, feed it to the network, and write the output data back to the middleware.
Additionally, it takes care of enabling and resetting the network.
Most of the logic that does not directly deal with the middleware lives in the xref:::buffered-network-wrapper.adoc[Buffered Network Wrapper].
