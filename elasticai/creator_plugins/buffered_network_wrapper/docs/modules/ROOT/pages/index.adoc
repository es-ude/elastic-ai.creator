= Buffered network wrapper

The current skeleton implementation uses an address based interface. But many VHDL plugins use an interface resembling AXI.
The buffered network wrapper acts as an adapter between these two interfaces.
It will:

. receive input data from the middleware
. remove padding from the input data
. buffer the result
. use a sliding window to feed the buffered data to the network
. pad output data for the middleware

====
The wrapper instantiates the network as

[,vhdl]
----
network_i: entity work.network(rtl) ...
----

Make sure to define your network as such.

== Network interface

The wrapper expects the network to define the following interface:

|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `clk`
| `std_logic`
| Clock signal

| `valid_in`
| `std_logic`
| `'1'` on *rising* edge signals valid input data

| `valid_out`
| `std_logic`
| `'1'` on *rising* edge signals valid output data

| `rst`
| `std_logic`
a| asynchronous reset

* set to `'1'` to reset the network
* set to `'0'` to release the reset and allow processing

| `d_in`
| `std_logic_vector`
| input data window

| `d_out`
| `std_logic_vector`
| all output data
