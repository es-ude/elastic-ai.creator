    The `ModelReport` aims to ease the verification of neural networks
    implemented in hardware. Given a model and a corresponding data
    provider it will produce a csv file containing the model's inference
    results on said data. Additionally it will store the paths to the
    inferred data samples so that another tool can use the data samples
    and the produced csv file to check that the hw model produces the
    same output as the software model for every data sample.
